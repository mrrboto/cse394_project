### Brief Description: 
MapTrac is an app that allows the user to keep track of places they have traveled to in the past.  It poses as a journal that keeps track of both good and bad reviews based on your own opinions.  The user has the ability to take a picture of the area they have been in, write a review, and keep track of the location without having to jot down addresses.  The design of this app will incorporate features such as a map view, live photo capture, geocoding, table views, and text views.
